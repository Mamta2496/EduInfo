        <p class="sectiontag text-big">Importance of Education</p>
        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">To say Education is important is an understatement. Education is a
             weapon to improve one’s life. It is probably the most important tool to change one’s life. Education for 
             a child begins at home. It is a lifelong process that ends with death. Education certainly determines the
              quality of an individual’s life. Education improves one’s knowledge, skills and develops the personality 
              and attitude. Most noteworthy, Education affects the chances of employment for people. A highly educated individual 
              is probably very likely to get a good job. In this essay on importance of education, we will tell you about the value
               of education in life and society</p>

        <p class="sectiontag text-big">Digital Modern way Of Education</p>
        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">The digitisation has long arrived in the middle of society and affects far more
             areas than just the world of work, even if it is already progressively developed here and the terms "industry 4.0"
             or "Internet of Things" (IoT) are often used. However, the education sector often lags behind these new developments
             and the resulting challenges. It can be assumed, that in future it will no longer be sufficient to impart a relatively
             large amount of knowledge in a short period of time, which will then also be tested in regular exams. The digitalised
             world demands new competences! Smart Schools are an innovative approach of the education sector to adjust to these
             conditions. These are areas in which pupils are able to learn digitally through appropriate educational opportunities.
             Basically, Smart Schools consist of three pillars which are equally decisive for the success of the concept.</p>

        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Technology plays an increasingly significant role in improving 
            access to education for people living in impoverished areas and developing countries.
             However, lack of technological advancement is still causing barriers with regards to quality 
             and access to education in developing countries.Charities like One Laptop per Child are 
             dedicated to providing infrastructures through which the disadvantaged may access educational materials.
             The OLPC foundation, a group out of MIT Media Lab and supported by several major corporations, has a stated
              mission to develop a $100 laptop for delivering educational software. The laptops were widely available as 
              of 2008. They are sold at cost or given away based on donations</p>
